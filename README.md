- 👋 Hi, I’m Shoaib Ahmed Khan
- 👀 I’m interested in Exploring new Technolgies and I have been working as a developer for around a decade. During this time, I have got a chance to visit various domains and technologies -- Which helped in shaping my self on how I think and work now.\n\nI like to create software and helping other developers like me around. Recently have gained interest in making more layman talks than the development intensive, as I believe everyone attached to a concept should have a right to understand it in complete and concise way.\n\nSome recent technologies I have been working are NodeJS, PHP, Docker and others of such kind. My main focus is towards the problem solving, irrespective of the platform.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any thing that can help humans.
